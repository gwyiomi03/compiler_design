# 🚀 Python-Based Simple Calculator Language

(Front-End Compiler Design Project)

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a Python-inspired Simple Calculator Language to demonstrate front-end compiler design concepts.

It supports arithmetic expressions, variable assignments, and mathematical function evaluation, and is built for educational purposes.

The project is intended for educational purposes, helping students understand how lexical analysis, parsing, and syntax-directed execution work in practice.

## ✨ Features

✅ Python-like syntax for ease of use

✅ Expression evaluation with variables

✅ Support for arithmetic operators

✅ GUI-based visualization using Qt Framework

✅ Designed as a front-end compiler (lexing, parsing, PDA/grammar concepts)

## 🛠 Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Qt Creator (recommended)
- C++ compiler (MinGW (Windows) or MSVC)
- VS Code (optional, but useful)


## ▶️ How to Run the Project
### Option A: Using Qt Creator (Recommended)

1. **Install Qt**
   - Download the Qt installer from the official website: https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
   - During install, include a compiler (MinGW or MSVC).

2. **Add Qt to PATH**
   - Add the Qt `bin` folder to your system PATH, e.g.:  
     `C:\Qt\6.x.x\mingw_64\bin`

3. **Open the Project**
   - Launch **Qt Creator**
   - Open the project by selecting `CMakeLists.txt`.

4. **Configure & Run**
   - Choose a kit like **Desktop Qt 6.10.1**
   - Accept the defaults and press **Build and Run** (or **F5**)
